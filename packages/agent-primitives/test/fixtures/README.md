# verify detector fixtures

Two kinds of fixture live here, both consumed only by `verify.test.ts` and
`cli.test.ts`; neither is picked up by this package's own `npm test`
(`vitest.config.ts` excludes `test/fixtures/**`).

## `captured/`

Raw stdout+stderr text, captured once from real tool runs against tiny
throwaway projects (not committed), then trimmed of the capture
directory's own absolute path and wall-clock timing so the fixture holds
only the output shape a detector parses. Tool versions used for the
capture:

- vitest 4.1.11
- typescript 5.9.3 (`tsc`)
- eslint 10.9.1 (stylish formatter, the CLI default; developing against
  this package requires Node `^20.19.0 || ^22.13.0 || >=24` for that
  reason, narrower than this package's own published `engines.node
  >=20`, since eslint is a devDependency only)

`tsc-vitest-concat.txt` is the one exception: not a raw capture, but two
of the other captures (`tsc-errors.txt` and the vitest mixed-run capture)
concatenated, so a single check's output can be made to carry both
shapes at once for the ambiguous-selection tests. `tsc-errors-many.txt`
is a real capture too (a throwaway project with 70 type errors, one per
line), used to exercise the tail-truncation warning against more
diagnostic lines than exec.ts's own 60-line tail bound keeps.
`*-colorized.txt` fixtures carry ANSI SGR escape codes: the eslint one is
a real `FORCE_COLOR=1` capture (stylish colorizes by default outside a
TTY-detected terminal); the tsc one is inline SGR sequences hand-added to
a real capture, since `tsc --pretty false` (the shape this detector
targets) never colorizes on its own, so there is no non-pretty colorized
shape to capture from a real run.

## `vitest-project/`, `tsc-project/`, `eslint-project/`

Minimal, self-contained projects with one deliberately failing check
each, used by the live integration tests: each project's `package.json`
script calls its tool by bare name (`vitest run`, `tsc --noEmit --pretty
false`, `eslint .`), which resolves through this package's own
`node_modules/.bin` via npm's normal ancestor-directory lookup (these
fixtures need no `node_modules` of their own). No reporter flags are
passed; detectors parse the tool's default text output.
